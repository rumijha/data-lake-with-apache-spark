## Data Lake with Apache Spark


#### Project Description
A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database even more and want to move their data warehouse to a data lake. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, and JSON metadata on the songs in their app. Here I have built an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, processes them using Spark, and loads the data back into S3 as a set of dimensional tables. The processed data will allow the analytics team to find insights into what songs their users are listening to most frequently


#### Datasets
Datasets used in this project resides in pulic access S3 bucket.Below are the S3 links for each:\
      Song data: s3://udacity-dend/song_data\
      Log data: s3://udacity-dend/log_data\
The datasets are JSON files namely song_data and log_data

###### Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json\
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.\
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}

###### Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.\
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json\
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
song_data holds the details of the song and its artists\
log_data hold the details of users which tell what songs is being heard and others

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

#### Database Design

##### Fact Table
**songplays** - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong
* *songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent*

##### Dimension Tables
**users** - users in the app
* *user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level*

**songs** - songs in music database
* *song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration*

**artists** - artists in music database
* *artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude*

**time** - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
* *start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday*


#### Project Files
In addition to the data files, the project includes two files:
* *etl.py* reads data from S3, processes that data using Spark, and writes them back to S3.
* *dwh.cfg* contains your AWS credentials.


#### How To Run the Project
Run etl.py to extract all the files under given S3 path, transform it and write it back to S3 destination path.
